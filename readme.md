# Chess app

This is a project that I have to do for college in C++.

It's just a chess game, nothing special about it.

Written for MacOS at the beginning however, I will try to make it crossplatform

## What did I use:

- CMake
- Ninja (for building)
- C++
- QML

maybe I will add database in the future, who knows
